Clean code is the practice of writing software that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and consistency in coding practices. The main idea behind clean code is to reduce complexity, make it more accessible for collaboration, and minimize the chances of introducing bugs. Clean code not only benefits developers but also improves the overall quality and longevity of a software project, making it easier to adapt and extend as needed.
